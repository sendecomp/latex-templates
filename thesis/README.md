Missouri University of Science and Technology
=============================================
OGS-approved class and template files for theses and dissertations.

* proofs:  pdf versions of the template using various class and format options.
* source_class: the ins and dtx files for the mstthesis class.
* source_template: the ins and dtx files for the templates based on the mstthesis class.
* template_pto: template files for a publication-thesis-option thesis or dissertation.
* template_rpc: template files for a report-class thesis or dissertation.

The template_pto and and template_rpc subdirectories contain a fully-functional template which can be used to verify a local LaTeX environment.

The class and template files have been developed in a unix environment and, in my own environment, are compiled with a Makefile.  The Makefiles are included but not necessary, depending upon your OS/environment.
